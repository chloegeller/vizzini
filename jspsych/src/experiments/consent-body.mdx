Dear Participant,

You are being asked to participate in a project being conducted by a
research team at Harvard University, under the direction of Dr. Tomer Ullman. We
are interested in how people are able to reason quickly and in a commonsense
way about different objects and people they encounter in the world around
them. A better understanding of commonsense reasoning has implications for
building more intelligent machines that can reason in a more human-like way, lowering
risk in different physical situations. During this study, you will be presented
with four different scenarios. To assess your understanding of these scenarios, you will
be shown a description of them, as well as examples, and need to provide sentences for each scenario.

This study will last around 10-15 minutes. Your participation in this study
is completely voluntary. You may refuse to participate, or you may choose
to withdraw from participation at any time, without penalty or loss of
benefit to which you are otherwise entitled. There has been no harm to people
involved in this study and there are no risks associated with participation.

All information collected from the study will be associated with a
randomly generated Prolific code or Prolific Worker ID, which is the only
identifying data you will be requested to provide. Unless your Prolific profile is
set to private, this ID can be linked back to your user account. We suggest you
set your profile to private. This ID will be changed to Study IDs upon
payment. Only researchers associated with this project will have access to the data.
In order to make research transparent to the scientific and broader community,
our study design and unidentifiable data are made publicly available on the
[Open Science Framework][osf], a network of research materials and
collaboration software, but your data will not be identifiable in any way.

We will also provide a demographic questionnaire. The form does not
include any personally identifying information other than your Prolific Worker ID.
Your contribution to this questionnaire is voluntary; if you choose to
provide the requested information, your responses will be confidential. You will be
reimbursed at a rate of $10/hr for your participation. You might be
requested to provide your Prolific Worker ID for reimbursement purposes, but this ID
will be deleted immediately after reimbursement.

Your participation in our study would be greatly appreciated. If you
have questions about the project, please feel free to contact us
