## In this study, we are interested in gathering sentences for four different scenarios.

<div className="py-2 w-100" />

### This study has **10 rounds**.

<div className="py-2 w-100" />

For each round, you will be asked to give a
<span className="probable">**PROBABLE**</span> sentence.

You will then have to change the **last word of the sentence** three times
to make the scenario <span className="improbable">**IMPROBABLE**</span>,
<span className="impossible">**IMPOSSIBLE**</span>, and lastly into a
<span className="typeError">**TYPE ERROR**</span>.

<div className="py-2 w-100" />

<Alert kind="info">
    **YOUR TASK**: For each **<span className="probable">PROBABLE</span>**
    sentence, please enter a new word to make the sentence
    <span className="improbable">**IMPROBABLE**</span>,
    <span className="impossible">**IMPOSSIBLE**</span>,
    and a <span className="typeError">**TYPE ERROR**</span>.
